# DocxDoclet Project

This repository contains two projects for the purpose of auto-creating `.docx` documents from the javadoc comments in the code.

<hr/>

*docxDoclet* is the code for the doclet itself, see the example on how to use it.
*docxDocletTester* is a test project for testing the featues of the doclet by generating a docx from template.
